You will be given unstructured stakeholder notes, interviews, or meeting summaries.

Output the following:

1. A list of high-level business requirements
2. Functional and non-functional requirements
3. Suggested user stories in this format:
   - As a <user type>, I want to <action>, so that <benefit>.
4. Clear acceptance criteria for each user story
5. Any implicit risks, constraints, or assumptions

Use professional, BA-style language.
