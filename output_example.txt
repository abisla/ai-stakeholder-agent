### Risks, Constraints, Assumptions:
- Risks: There is a risk of security breaches as we're dealing with sensitive payment information. There's also a risk of system failure during peak hours if the system can't handle high traffic.
- Constraints: The system's performance during peak hours and the speed of receipt generation may be constrained by our current server capacity.
- Assumptions: We assume that adding multiple payment methods will satisfy user requests and that saving payment information will make the transaction process faster and more convenient for returning customers.
